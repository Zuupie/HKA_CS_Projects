# HKA_CS_Projects
All my tasks of the University of Applied Science [HKA] will be in this repo

---

To execute the files, you must first install Java. 
<br> After installing Java, you have to open the terminal and compile (.class) the file by typing in
"javac filename.java". <br> Now you can execute it with the command "java filename". 

Have fun! :)
